## Core Features:

- Need Submission: Allow NGOs/communities to submit resource requests, specifying the required items (e.g., blankets, food), quantity, and location.
- Resource Offering: Enable individuals and teams to register as potential donors or volunteers, specifying the resources they can provide and their location.
- Geospatial Matching: Automatically match resource requests with the nearest available donors/volunteers within a specified radius (e.g., 5km) using location data.
- Instant Connection: Provide a direct communication channel (e.g., in-app messaging, email notification) to connect the requesting party with the matched donor/volunteer.
- Dynamic Radius Tool: Use the LLM as a tool to suggest a different radius, by reasoning about location density.
